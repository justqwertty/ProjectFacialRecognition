# Huge Credits to Murtaza Hassan's FACE RECOGNITION + ATTENDANCE PROJECT | OpenCV Python | Computer Vision Video and Adam Geitge's Machine Learning is Fun! Part 4: Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning

# Both of these legends made very easy to understand Explanations to Facial Recognition

in a nutshell its basically these 4 steps 

step 1 is to find the face

step 2 is to make out each face even if its looking at another direction

step 3 is to pick out unique features of the face like size of eyes and how long the face is

step 4 is to compare the unique features to all the faces you know

which is then used by Adam Geitge's Face_Recognition Module in python

Highly reccomend you check out  Murtaza Hassan's FACE RECOGNITION + ATTENDANCE PROJECT | OpenCV Python | Computer Vision Video to get an idea on how to use this 

and then check out Adam Geitge's Machine Learning is Fun! Part 4: Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning

as he takes Inspiration from Articles listed below

-Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection by Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs

-One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan

-FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko and James Philbin

Highly reccomend reading their research to get a better understanding on how all of this works
